4. django automatically generates primary key for the entries in the table, hence id field generation is not required.
5. Inbuilt Usercreation form is used to to registerform along with customized fields.

6. Vanilla views are nothing but non class based views
7. Initially when any request is made, they are internally sent to dispatch method who is responsible to categorize it GET or POST method.
8. To get data onto form or anywhere get method is called, e.g passing userId through URL will hit get method where Id will be used to retrieve
    object from model.
9. Post method can be used when accepting input from user. After data is got from model, user may/may not make changes using form. So this
    changed data is sent using POST method to save in model.
